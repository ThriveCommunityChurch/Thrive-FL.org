# Thrive-FL.org
This repo is meant to hold the headless React app for the new version of the thrive-fl.org website. 

### Motivations
Utilizing some of our exiting tooling and some licensed content we aim to make the marketing site dual funtionality such that members can login to gain access to different features. Additionally, this will bring back the teaching series list.
